# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Internship Project Summary

This project was completed as part of my internship program, focusing on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns and contributing factors.

### Objectives
- Analyze accident patterns related to time, weather, and road conditions
- Visualize accident hotspots geographically
- Identify key contributing factors to accidents
- Provide actionable insights for improving road safety

### Dataset
The analysis uses the [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) from Kaggle, which contains approximately 3.5 million accident records collected from February 2016 to June 2023.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying patterns and relationships
3. **Visualization**: Creating informative charts and maps
4. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping accident hotspots
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying significant factors

### Key Insights
1. **Temporal Patterns**: 
   - Peak accident times coincide with rush hours (8-9 AM and 4-6 PM)
   - Weekdays have higher accident rates than weekends
   - Certain months show increased accident frequency

2. **Weather Impact**:
   - Most accidents occur in clear weather conditions
   - Adverse weather (rain, snow, fog) increases accident severity
   - Reduced visibility is a significant contributing factor

3. **Road Features**:
   - Junctions and intersections are high-risk locations
   - Presence of traffic signals correlates with accident frequency
   - Certain road features (crossings, stops) are associated with specific accident types

4. **Geographical Distribution**:
   - Urban areas show higher accident density
   - Specific highways and routes are accident hotspots
   - Regional variations in accident patterns

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
- Folium, Geopandas (geospatial analysis)
- Jupyter Notebooks
